# üë©üèª‚Äçüíª About Me üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
I've recently graduated with honors as a Computer Science major with a minor in Interactive Media and Legal Studies at NYUAD. My biggest academic and professional strengths are a determined work ethic, being a flexible team player, and being an efficient communicator. Having worked in various settings and positions, in and outside of school, I have developed rapid critical thinking, especially when working under pressure, which is an applicable skill for many work environments. I can operate as both a cooperative teammate and an efficient leader given what the circumstances demand.
